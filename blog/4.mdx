The following text provides tips for a college freshman from a graduating college student. The five tips cover important aspects of college life, including: thinking about your thesis early, not feeling pressured to make the "right choice" in your field of study, prioritizing mental health, choosing friends wisely, and not compromising on sleep. The tips aim to help the freshman have a more successful and enjoyable college experience.

## 1. Start thinking about your thesis as early as possible

I am not joking when I say that your thesis will be one of your most stressful project (if not the most ) in your college life. And the hardest part about your thesis is thinking about an idea to do. No matter what stage you are in your college life, think about your thesis already. Your future self will thank you.

My advice is to choose something simple and just do it well. You can even seek out a professor who has research interests similar to yours and ask for advice. They might even become your future research adviser.

Additionally, starting early also gives you ample time to conduct research, gather data and resources, and experiment with different ideas. This will allow you to make any necessary changes before it's too late, and ensure that your thesis is of high quality.

Another tip is to choose a topic that you are genuinely interested in and passionate about. This will make the writing process more enjoyable and keep you motivated. And remember, your thesis is a representation of your skills and knowledge, so take the time to craft a well-researched and well-written paper.

## 2. Don't feel pressured to make the "right choice" when you start college

People change, you do too. Your interests will change as you grow and you may find that as you go into your choice of degree that it was not as you thought it was. Do not feel pressured to finish the course or even continue it as a career when you graduate.

My advice is, keep exploring. Do not limit yourself to your degree. Go find more hobbies or what I call, "side quests". Read up on a lot of things even if it's not related to your course.

But I do have to note: Be practical. If you are halfway complete in terms of the number of units, you should probably just finish the degree and pursue a career unrelated to your course.

College is not just about academics. It is also a great opportunity to get involved in extracurricular activities and develop new interests. Whether it is a sports team, student government, or a club, there are many opportunities to get involved on campus. These activities will not only enhance your college experience, but they will also help you build skills that will be useful after graduation.

College is a time to explore your interests and find out what you are passionate about. Take advantage of the many opportunities available to you, such as study abroad programs, internships, and research opportunities. These experiences will not only help you build your resume, but they will also help you find your calling.

## 3. Your mental health is just as important as your physical health

Depression and anxiety do not just go away because you want them to.

Please, be kind to yourself. There will be days that are less productive than you thought. There will be times when you feel that things aren't going well. There will be moments where you are not at your best. Those are okay - life is not a series of constant ups.

This also means that if you 

And if you are struggling with mental health, talk to someone but know some limits. Your friends are not your therapists. Do not put too much pressure on them and learn to get professional help.

Compare yourself to the person you were yesterday - not to others

## 4. Choose your friends wisely

You will find many toxic people in college. Avoid them. And you will find amazing and wonderful people in college. Go to them.

Your friends will help you get through college much easier. And don't forget: Your friends don't all have to be your batchmates. You can have friends from the higher and lower batches. And even from different universities.

Having a supportive group of friends can greatly enhance your college experience, and can also help you grow as a person. Surround yourself with positive and uplifting individuals who bring out the best in you and who are there to support you through your ups and downs. And, if you do find yourself in a difficult situation, your friends can be a valuable source of support.

Also, try to find friends who share similar interests and goals as you. This can lead to fun experiences and new opportunities, and it can also help you stay motivated and on track. Whether you join a club or organization together, or simply explore your favorite hobbies and activities, having friends who share your interests will make your time in college that much more enjoyable.

## 5. Do not compromise on sleep

If you want a tip on how to get good grades: Sleep properly. A rule is that 90 minutes of sleep is a complete sleep cycle. You should have 5 sleep cycles per day.

I'm not joking about the grades part - sleep is very important for proper brain function. If you find yourself having to do an all-night studying, at the very least learn when to stop. You will find that at some point you're just not getting anything anymore.

Additionally, sacrificing sleep for extended periods of time can have a serious impact on your physical and mental health. It can lead to feelings of fatigue, stress, anxiety, and depression, and can also weaken your immune system, making you more susceptible to illness.

Sleep also plays a crucial role in helping you consolidate your memory and process the information you have learned throughout the day. If you are well-rested, you will be better able to retain the information you have studied and apply it effectively when it comes time for exams.

In order to ensure that you are getting enough sleep, establish a regular sleep schedule and stick to it as much as possible. This will help regulate your circadian rhythm and make it easier for you to fall asleep and wake up at the same time each day. Also, avoid consuming caffeine and electronics before bedtime, as they can interfere with your ability to get a good night's sleep.

## 6. Do not expect handholding from anyone. You really have to do things on your own from time to time

When you are in high school, you will probably have a lot of support from your teachers. If you are still in high school and doubt that, it's likely true even for you.

In college, you likely won't have a class adviser. You likely will have to find out where to get the news. It will be your fault if you were not informed of an event happening. If you have a problem with someone or something, it is expected that you will talk to the proper people yourself.

It's important to understand that in college, you are viewed as an adult and are expected to take responsibility for your own learning and experiences. This means that you will have to be proactive and resourceful, seeking out information and support as needed.

One of the best ways to succeed in college is to take advantage of all the resources available to you. Attend office hours and seek out help from your professors and classmates. Join clubs and organizations that align with your interests and goals. Utilize the college's career center and other support services to help you navigate your college experience.

At the same time, it's important to be self-sufficient and not rely solely on others to guide your way. Take the initiative to attend events and workshops that interest you, even if no one is encouraging you to go. Network with people in your field of study and beyond to make connections and learn about opportunities.

So if you're socially anxious, college will likely be much more difficult.

## 7. Save the money you have

You will be the target of many scams in your college life because you will be seen as naive and dumb.

This is especially true when it comes to your finances. In college, you will be faced with numerous expenses, from tuition and textbooks to housing and food. And while you may be tempted to spend your money freely, it's important to exercise caution and save as much as you can.

One of the biggest mistakes that many college students make is taking out student loans without fully understanding the consequences. Student loans can quickly add up, leaving you with a heavy debt burden that can take years to pay off.

To avoid this, create a budget and stick to it as much as possible. Consider working part-time to supplement your income, or look for scholarships and grants to help cover your expenses.

Additionally, be wary of scams that target college students, such as predatory lenders and credit card offers that promise "instant approval" or "zero interest" rates. Read the fine print and understand the terms and conditions before you sign up for any financial products.

I'd say, the best thing you can do in college is to learn when to have enough financially. Of course, you can buy that latest iPhone. But don't chase it.

## **BONUS**: Do not take risks you don't have the capacity to take

You will encounter many people who says that "Bill Gates dropped out of college" or "Mark Zuckerberg did not graduate". In the Philippines, you will hear, "Bakit ako mageeffort kung PHP 15K lang naman sahod ko pagtapos ko kahit cum laude ako?" (Why would I put in effort if I will only earn PHP 15K when I graduate even as a cum laude?)

Please, ignore them as much as possible. I know it is difficult for you but know that Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg had the safety nets to actually drop out. Also, they did not drop out just because it's cool - they dropped out because their respective companies took so much of their time that they had to make a choice.

Furthermore, see college as a way of developing your soft skills. You will likely find that they will be more helpful when you graduate than the hard skills. These soft skills include proper time management which can and usually translates to better hard skills.

Additionally, it's important to remember that not everyone has the same risk tolerance or financial capability. Just because someone you know dropped out of college and became successful, it doesn't mean that you should do the same.

Before taking any risks, it's important to assess your own financial and personal circumstances. Do you have a safety net in case things don't go as planned? Are you prepared to face the consequences of your actions?

If you're not comfortable with taking a certain risk, it's okay to say no. There is no shame in being cautious and taking a more traditional path. Your career and financial stability should be your top priority.

Ultimately, it's important to remember that success can come in many forms, and college can be a valuable tool in helping you achieve your goals. Whether you decide to drop out or complete your degree, the most important thing is to have a clear understanding of your options and make a well-informed decision.
