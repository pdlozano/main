Forms - they are almost necessary for data collection especially if it involves people.
But damn do they suck. I dread answering many forms and I know many people do too. And
the problem with that is people do not answer them.

To combat the dread and frustration that people often experience when filling out forms,
it's crucial to design them in a way that makes the process as simple and straightforward
as possible. By taking steps to optimize the form-filling experience, you can increase
the likelihood that people will complete the form and provide accurate, valuable
information.

And as someone who answered a LOT of forms and made a few of them myself, I can give
you a few ideas on how to do so.

Also, if you are reading this, this post is more suited to researchers and people who use
forms to gather data for anything (e.g. events). I also assume you're using Google Forms
since that's basically standard here in the Philippines. If not, the tips here still
apply to any other form app you're using. Just note that these tips assume you're using
Google Forms.

## 0. Get the minimum amount of data you need to get and nothing more

Yes it is point 0 because it is that important. I constantly see forms that take in more
data than what is needed or makes my eyebrows go "what do they need this for?"

For example, why do so many forms insist on me giving out my address? Or my phone number?
What is it for? Are they planning to do identity theft?

If you have a valid reason for asking, at the very least, use the description to explain.
Do not assume that people will know - they won't. And you are the one asking for sensitive
information. The least you can do is to explain it.

And remember, the Data Privacy Act of the Philippines REQUIRES you to only collect data
that is for a legitimate purpose. It is why I wonder why people do this for no reason at
all.

Asking for the minimum amount of data you need also means a shorter form and people are
more receptive to shorter forms.

## 1. Avoid Text Inputs When Possible

Text inputs mean you are going to clean the data.

## 2. If your form has more than five questions, let people come back to it

This is another pet peeve of mine. Why do people insist that I fill out a form
immediately? What is wrong with filling it out partially AND THEN coming back to it?

Of course, there are certain cases where it is ok to do that but there are so many
cases where it is isn't. A reservation form

3. Do not ask for data that the person might not know the answer to
For example, if you're asking for the date of graduation, they might be able to tell you the year and maybe the month. But the day? Most people won't be able to answer this.

Now, the date form in Google Forms cannot filter by date so my tip is to use the description box to indicate that the exact day is not important and only the month and the year will be of use.

4. If a field is conditional, make it so
This is not a paper form - you're making an online form. Why do you need to say, "If you answered YES to the previous question, how many is it?" Just make sections.

NOTE: It can be daunting to have multiple sections so tell your users in advance that some of them are for conditional questions.

5. There is almost always a better option than a dropdown

6. If you are asking for something sketchy, tell people why you need it
For example, if you need my phone number to sign up for an event, why? Especially if I already gave my email address, what will you use it for?

If you're the organizer, this may be obvious to you but not to the users.

7. Address any confusion early on and let people contact you

If something is multiple choice, make the choices make sense

BONUS 1: If you care about privacy, use differential privacy

BONUS 2: Do not be afraid to be human
