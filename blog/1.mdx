I still remember when I first became a college freshman. It was a pretty normal day but
I could only imagine how annoying I must have been to the seniors. Because I knew pretty
much no one, I basically had to socialize with other people.

And then, the pandemic came before my first year ended and everything became chaotic.
Oh well, nothing much happened except everything. But I was lucky my university was much
better prepared for online classes than most others since it has conducted it before
partially. Thus, the pressure to move to online-only classes were not as bad as it could
have been.

However, now that I am graduating (and not in an online-only setting), I have some tips
that a freshman or even 2nd year students might find useful.

## 1. Start thinking about your thesis as early as possible

I am not joking when I say that your thesis will be one of your most stressful project
(if not the most stressful) in your college life. And the hardest part about your thesis
is thinking about an idea to do. I know people who still do not know what to do after
years. No matter what stage you are in your college life, think about your thesis already.
Your future self will thank you.

My advice is to choose something simple and just do it well. Do not try to do something
that has never been done before. That's the job of a PhD student. Instead, focus on
something you know you can do.

You can even seek out a professor who has research interests similar to yours and ask for
advice. They might even become your future research adviser. And for Mapuans, yes, that's
ok to do. Though I do believe they might find it weird that you're thinking about it early
but overall, they would generally help you.

Additionally, starting early also gives you ample time to conduct research, gather data and
resources. This will allow you to make any necessary changes before it's too late, and
ensure that your thesis is of high quality.

## 2. Don't feel pressured to make the "right choice" when you start college

People change, you do too. Your interests will change as you grow, and you may find that as
you go into your choice of degree that it was not as you thought it was. Do not feel
pressured to finish the degree or even continue it as a career when you graduate if something
is telling you that you are on the wrong path. Remember the [Sunk Cost Fallacy][0]: Just
because you already invested time into something does not mean you cannot get out of it
anymore.

My advice is, keep exploring. Do not limit yourself to your degree. Go find more hobbies or
what I call, "side quests". Read up on a lot of things even if it's not related to your course.
College is not just about academics. It is also a great opportunity to get involved in things
like sports, student government, or clubs.

But I do have to note: Be practical. If you are halfway complete in terms of the number of
units, you should probably just finish the degree and pursue a career unrelated to your course.
The first two years are usually focused on "general coursework" so switching will not really
delay the time it takes for you to get your degree. However, after that, you get into more
specialized subjects that will just raise your cost of tuition and the time it takes for you
to have a career.

## 3. Your mental health is just as important as your physical health

Depression and anxiety do not just go away because you want them to. I know the Philippines
is still not entirely accepting of mental health but that does not mean you shouldn't. Mental
health is a real thing and people do get burned out and get anxious about school.

Just because people say, "Wow, you can't even get through this? What would happen if you are
now in the real world?" does not mean your feelings are invalid. Of course you'll get
exhausted sometimes, and it's okay to take a break.

Please, be kind to yourself. There will be days that are less productive than you thought.
There will be times when you feel that things aren't going well. There will be moments where you
are not at your best. Those are okay - life is not a series of constant ups.

And if you are struggling with mental health, talk to someone but know some limits. Your friends
are not your therapists. Do not put too much pressure on them and learn when to get professional
help. [This article by Philstar contains a list of places where you can get it (with some offering
free counseling)][1].

**Sidenote**: I generally advise you not to go to your school's counselor if you don't want your
parents to know about it. Some schools have policies for some reason that they should tell them
about what you talked about. (Do not ask me why because I also do not understand since by
college you are considered an adult).

## 4. Choose your friends wisely

You will find many toxic people in college. Avoid them. And you will find amazing and
wonderful people in college. Go to them.

Your friends will help you get through college much easier. And don't forget: Your friends
don't all have to be your batchmates. You can have friends from the higher and lower batches.
And even from different universities.

Having a supportive group of friends can greatly enhance your college experience, and can also
help you grow as a person. Surround yourself with positive and uplifting individuals who bring
out the best in you and who are there to support you through your ups and downs. And, if you do
find yourself in a difficult situation, your friends can be a valuable source of support.

Also, try to find friends who share similar interests and goals as you. This can lead to fun
experiences and new opportunities, and it can also help you stay motivated and on track. Whether
you join a club or organization together, or simply explore your favorite hobbies and activities,
having friends who share your interests will make your time in college that much more enjoyable.

## 5. Do not compromise on sleep

If you want a tip on how to get good grades: Sleep properly. A rule is that 90 minutes of sleep
is a complete sleep cycle, and you should have 5 sleep cycles per day.

I'm not joking about the grades part - sleep is very important for proper brain function. If you
find yourself having to do an all-night studying, at the very least learn when to stop. You will
find that at some point you're just not getting anything anymore.

I know that you can be a night owl and all of that, but some people see "night owl" as somehow
"I need less sleep". No - if you are a night owl, you still need proper sleep just at a different
point in the day.

Additionally, sacrificing sleep for extended periods of time can have a serious impact on your
physical and mental health. Don't sacrifice on it - keep a regular sleep schedule and stick to
it as much as possible. Over time, you will find that you might not even need an alarm anymore
as you will wake up even before it rings.

As for caffeine, a good rule I use is "No coffee after 6 hours before bedtime". I find that by
that point, it no longer has a huge effect. [This scientific article][2] was my basis for this
decision back in high school and I find that it is pretty accurate.

## 6. Do not expect handholding from anyone. You really have to do things on your own from time to time

When you are in high school, you will probably have a lot of support from your teachers. If you
are still in high school and doubt that, it's likely true even for you.

In college, you likely won't have a class adviser. You likely will have to find out where to get
the news. It will be your fault if you were not informed of an event happening. If you have a
problem with someone or something, it is expected that you will talk to the proper people yourself.
For example, if were you absent for an important exam, most professors will not care unless you ask
for a remedial yourself.

It's important to understand that in college, you are (mostly) viewed as an adult and are expected
to take responsibility for your own learning and experiences. This means that you will have to be
proactive and resourceful, seeking out information and support as needed.

It's important to be self-sufficient and not rely solely on others to guide your way. Take the
initiative to attend events and workshops that interest you, even if no one is encouraging you to
go. Network with people in your field of study and beyond to make connections and learn about
opportunities.

And yes, if you're socially anxious, college will likely be much more difficult if you do not prepare
for these things.

## 7. Focus on being financially literate

You will be the target of many scams in your college life because you will be seen as naive and
dumb. You will be enticed to join businesses, networking schemes, get-quick-rich schemes, and more
because you are vulnerable.

Learn to be financially literate. In college, you will be faced with numerous expenses, from
tuition and textbooks to housing and food. And while you may be tempted to spend your money freely,
it's important to exercise caution and save as much as you can.

And while you might have help from parents or other relatives, that is not an excuse to freely spend
everything you can. To avoid this, create a budget and stick to it as much as possible.

I won't give too much financial advice because there are so many out there already and I do not
know your situation personally. I generally recommend [Simple Sum][3] and [The Woke Salaryman][4]
for advice. I also recommend you read "[The Psychology of Money][5]" since psychology is vital to
understanding why people make money mistakes. But to help you get a quickstart, here are some
general tips:

1. If it's too good to be true, it likely is. Free money is not free - there should be a catch.
   For example, Maya is known to give a lot of cashbacks, but they are doing that because they
   need users. You can see this as they stop giving more and more as they grow.
2. Create a budget and stick to it. The best budgeting app is a spreadsheet. If you're a Mapuan,
   MS Excel is free so use it. For now, try to do a 50-30-20 split: 50% for needs, 30% for wants,
   and 20% for saving and investing.
3. Debts destroy relationships. As much as possible, do not ask for money and do not lend money.
   I cannot stress this enough - do not lend money. If someone asks for money, consider it a gift.
   And if you cannot do so, get it in writing. There are many instances of people who never got
   paid and cannot chase it because the person who asked for money is their friend/relative.

## 8. Do not take risks you don't have the capacity to take

You will encounter many people who says that "Bill Gates dropped out of college" or "Mark Zuckerberg
did not graduate". In the Philippines, you will hear, "Bakit ako mageeffort kung PHP 15K lang naman
sahod ko pagtapos ko kahit cum laude ako?" (Why would I put in effort if I will only earn PHP 15K
when I graduate even as a cum laude?)

Please, ignore them as much as possible. I know it is difficult for you but know that Bill Gates
and Mark Zuckerberg had the safety nets to actually drop out. Also, they did not drop out just
because it's cool - they dropped out because their respective companies took so much of their time
that they had to make a choice.

It's important to remember that not everyone has the same risk tolerance or financial capability.
Just because someone you know dropped out of college and became successful, it doesn't mean that
you should do the same. I am honestly shocked by the amount of people who consistently say these
things as if everyone can afford to fail.

If you're not comfortable taking a certain risk, it's okay to say no. There is no shame in being
cautious and taking a more traditional path. Your career and financial stability should be your
top priority.

See college as a way of developing your soft skills. You will likely find that they will be more
helpful when you graduate than the hard skills. These soft skills include proper time management
which can and usually translates to better technical skills.

Ultimately, it's important to remember that success can come in many forms, and college can be a
valuable tool in helping you achieve your goals. Whether you decide to drop out or complete your
egree, the most important thing is to have a clear understanding of your options and make a
well-informed decision.

College is difficult. But good luck and make the most out of it. It is a time of growth and
change. By the end of your college life, I hope you find these years nostalgic but also ready
to take on the challenges from the world.
