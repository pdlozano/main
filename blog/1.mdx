Yes. Scare you. Because too many people think that a business is the secret `to` a lot of money. "Walang yumayaman na empleyado."

And then there's this post:

```python
def hello_world():
    pass
```

$$
y = a_0x_0^2 + a_1x_1 + a_2
$$

It always rubs me the wrong way because these people make you think that a job is wrong. It's not. A 9-5 job is perfectly okay. It is okay if you don't go into business. Nothing is wrong.
