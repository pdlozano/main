This is a small web app that tests you on various topics. The data for the web app comes from [the
Open Database Trivia API][0] which has three difficulty levels and twenty-four different categories.
The web app is designed to be playable even with a keyboard so that even people with motor
disabilities can only use one to move to the next section. It also takes color blindness into account
by creating different patterns for a "Correct answer" and a "Wrong answer".

I made this game originally to play it with other people during the pandemic. To make it fun, make
a rule that no one is allowed to Google. Of course, the game won't actually stop you but keep that
rule so that it makes it fair.

Two limitations of the website is that there is no way to backtrack and that you cannot know the
correct answer if you made the wrong guess.
