This deep learning project aims to classify different types of footwear (shoes, boots, and sandals)
from each other. The goal was to create an AI model that categorizes each footwear based on their
images. This model can be used to help sort different products in an e-commerce website focusing
on footwear to help save time categorizing. 15,000 images were used for this task and an accuracy of
95.54% was achieved with the best performing model.

Both neural networks and convolutional neural networks were used to build the model. The process
started with exploratory data analysis and then creating simple models and gradually it more
complex through experimentation. The model was saved in a `.pt` file that can be reused by other
scripts or improved upon.
