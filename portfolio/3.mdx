This notebook was partly built for a school report to demonstrate two curve fitting algorithms
which are Interpolation and Polynomial Regression. Instead of matplotlib, I opted to use plotly
to make the plots interactive instead of static.

## Process

In the first step of the process, values of x and y were given. Since the purpose of this was a
demonstration of the algorithms, random generation was done instead. Then, a plot was shown to
visualize the given data.

Second, the regression formulae was shown (below is the actual formula). The most common form of
regression is the linear regression and the principle is the same for quadratic regression, cubic
regression, and higher forms of regression. The goal is to make the line fit to the data in the
best way possible.

$$
\left[
\begin{matrix}
    \sum y \\
    \sum x_iy \\
    \sum x_i^2y \\
    ... \\
    \sum x_i^{(n-1)} y
\end{matrix}
\right] =
\left[
\begin{matrix}
    n & \sum x_i & \sum x_i^2 & ... & \sum x_i^{n-1} \\
    \sum x_iy & ... & ... & ... & ... &\\
    \sum x_i^2y & ... & ... & ... & ... &\\
    ... & ... & ... & ... & \sum x_i^{2n-1}\\
\end{matrix}
\right]
\left[
\begin{matrix}
    a_0 \\
    a_1 \\
    ... \\
    a_{n-1} \\
\end{matrix}
\right]
$$

As this was again built for a school report, the step-by-step process to find the variables was
shown in the next steps before arriving at a single final equation. Afterwards, the equation was
graphed with the original data on top.

As seen in the above graph, only one point is very close to the curve but the curve itself shows
the trends in the data and can be used to predict future values which can be useful for things
like finance or logistics.

Next, Newton interpolation was then done whose formula is shown below. The step-by-step process
to find the variables are then shown before proceeding to graphing the line and the data.

$$
f(x) = f(x_0) + \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \Delta_{0,i} \prod_{j=0}^i (x-x_j)
$$

As shown in the above graph, the Newton interpolation actually tries to fit every point in a
single line. This is useful for predicting missing values. For example, imagine if you had data
for Sunday and Tuesday but not Monday. One way to fill in the missing value is to use the
value from interpolation.

Afterwards, several graphs are then shown to demonstrate both algorithms together. Below is a
graph of both regression and interpolation on `sin(x)`.
