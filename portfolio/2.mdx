This web app built using NextJS was created during a time when I was still exploring competitive
Pokémon. I wanted to create an app that helps me build a Pokémon team while making sure it does not
have many weaknesses or at the very least covers a lot of teams.

This app uses data from [PokéAPI][0] for movesets and sprites. There are many limitations to this
app and I recommend you use [Pikalytics][1] or [Showdown][2] if you want to build a competitive
team. This app was built more to demonstrate my skills in NextJS, web accessibility, and ability
to get data from APIs.

And if you want to challenge me to a battle, go message me. I prefer the VGC format over the Smogon
Singles format, but I can still play it if you want to.
